{-

SOLUTION:

Checks for every connection if the node is contained, returns the other node in the pair if there
is a connection. Gets result by concatenating all connected nodes.

-}

connected :: Map -> Node -> [Node]
connected [] _ = []
connected xs n = concatMap (\(a, b) -> if a == n then [b] else if b == n then [a] else []) xs

{-

SOLUTION:

- Simply append the new pair onto the list.
- Doesn't provide any new connections if self-loop or already included in the map.

-}

connect :: Node -> Node -> Map -> Map
connect _ _ [] = []
connect i j xs = if elem ((i, j)) (xs) then xs else (if (i == j) then xs else (xs ++ [(i, j)]))

{-

SOLUTION:

- Uses a filter which only keeps pairs that are not the nodes supplied.
- Checks if any pair are NOT equal, where no nodes are shared in either connection

-}

disconnect :: Node -> Node -> Map -> Map
disconnect i j xs = filter (\(a, b) -> notEqual (i, j) (a, b)) xs
  where
    notEqual :: (Node, Node) -> (Node, Node) -> Bool
    notEqual (a, b) (c, d) = a /= c && b /= d && b /= c && a /= d
    
{-

SOLUTION:

- Need to merge together p and the existing ps (the current party) so
that we do not include duplicates

-}

add :: Party -> Event
add p Over = Over
add p (Game x y ps z) = Game x y (msort (p ++ ps)) z

{-

SOLUTION: 

- Returns a new game with the party added to existing party at node position
- Can access this directly using the node as an index
- So use list comprehension to look over all parties in party list
- If index matches up with node, then concatenate

    addAt' n p pss = [if j == n then (msort (p ++ ps)) else ps | (j, ps) <- zip [0..] pss]

{-

SOLUTION:

- Uses addAt which is supplied with the current player's node (second parameter)

-}

addHere :: Party -> Event
addHere p Over = Over
addHere p (Game x current y z) = addAt current p (Game x current y z)

SOLUTION:

- Filter out all of the characters in p that are in ps

dialogue :: Game -> Dialogue -> IO Game

{-
SOLUTION:

(1) First puts the string into the console
(2) Then simply applies event to game state and returns this appropriately as output.

-}

dialogue game (Action s e) = do
    putStrLn s
    return (e game)

{-
SOLUTION:

(1) If branch condition, then continue to dialogue 1 (a)
(2) else continue to dialogue 2

Make recursive call to dialogues which will branch out until eventually
returning game state (when dialogues have completed).

--condition for no responses, simply show string and return game
dialogue game (Choice s []) = do

{-
SOLUTION:

(1) Displays string (dialogue text)
(2) Pairs up responses with an index (starting from 1) 
(3) Using monadic map (with _ as we only care about printing, not the result of the map) to print out every pair of (index: option)
(4) Display prompt
(5) Bind output to console to choice
(6) First checks if the choice (as integer) is contained within the indices
If so, then find the dialogue matching with this index, otherwise return the game with no further dialogue
This already satisifies the safety requirement in assignment (4a) since the case of input zero is not one of the 
elements of valid responses.
(7)
(8) Filters only for the index which matches up with the choice
Then selects the head (knowing all indices are unique this will be our single selected response)
Then selects the second value of the second tuple (this contains the Dialogue in our type construction)

{-

SOLUTION:

(1) First check whether party exists inside theDialogues (is one 
of the first values in all of the tuples) 
(2) If so, then extract this using a filter which selects the party
in theDialogues which matches up, then chooses the second element of this 
tuple which is the corresponding dialogue
(3) Otherwise return a Dialogue which terminates the game and displays
the required string.

------------------------- Assignment 3: The game loop

{-

SOLUTION:

(1) Prints out the description of the current location indexed by n
(2) Gets all of the locations which are connected to the current location, indexes
them from 1, and then uses monadic map (_ since only care about printing / side effect,
no collected result from the map), to show all of the indexes and the corresponding
locations
(3) Gets the index to count up from, which is the last index of the locationsToTravelTo,
then using monadic map again to display the characters in the player's party (p)
with corresponding indices.
(4) Same again, this time selecting the party corresponding to the current location n

Solution -

Implementation of recursive DFS, making use of the implicit call stack.

(1) First we make call to helper function which takes of nodes visited along current path AND all nodes visited along any path
(2) The result will be the initial self loop alongside all of the shortest path returned from a call to dfs for the map provided
(3) Implementation of recursive DFS:
  (a) if we find that we have already visited a node, stop calls to DFS (prevents infinite loop due to cycles in the map)
  (b) otherwise, we return the node alongside with the current path to reach it, and make another call to dfs with the new path, and visited including the new node searched.
  ConcatMap ensures that every call to dfs which returns a path and another call to dfs is included in one result list at the end.
(4) Simply gets all of the choices for all connected nodes so we can return what would be user input instead of the Nodes.
(5) Step where we remove any longer paths which would be returned from DFS since it doesn't search earliest first
  (5a) to get all paths in groups to the same node, we groupBy the first value being the same (the node reached). This can be done since we first sort all of the tuples meaning
  that all paths with same first value are contiguous 
  (5b) then we sort again for each sublist based on the length of the second value of tuples
  Then we call to map head to get the shortest path for every group.
